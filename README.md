L6123 - Advanced OpenACC Programming
====================================
This tutorial will teach experienced OpenACC programmers several techniques
that will take them to the next level in their code. Participants will learn
via hands-on examples how to pipeline computations to overlap data transfers,
multi-GPU programming, OpenACC interoperability, and more. Participants must be
comfortable with C/C++ or Fortran programming and already have experience with
OpenACC programming.
